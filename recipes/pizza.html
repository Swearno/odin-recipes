    <p class="text">
      This pizza recipe is one that you've never tried before. If you think that
      this pizza will taste like garbage, your wrong. Starts out with the dough,
      beating and rolling it until its in a perfect circle shape. Next grab your
      tomato sauce that was handpicked from Italy and evenly spread it across
      the dough until it's completely spread.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
      Then add your mozzarella cheese and nicely spread it across the sauced up
      dough till you can't see the sauce anymore. Finally pop it in the oven for
      20 minutes until crust is golden brown and leave it 2 minutes out of the
      oven to cool. Enjoy!
