    <p class="text">
      This freshly cooked rice is an amazing dish to have not only as a side but
      as a main meal. Added with a touch of butter and a pinch of cracked black
      pepper to make this rice taste even better. You've never had rice like
      this before so why not learn the recipe and try it out yourself.
